# Menger Encephalon -- The Blog of Prion
Welcome to my blog! And there will be lot of fun and huge of crazy things!



# The Meaning of the Menger Encephalon (Blog Name)
Firstly, I'm Prion, right? So I had to live in a brain. About this brain I live in, I hope it could be more wisdom, therefore, I selected the 'encephalon' (which comes from Acient Greek). 

A brain prion lives in was always like a sponge, both have a lot of holes. And I think I need to emphasize this characteristic in this brain's name. Then, I thought of a famous fractal -- Manger Sponge. In that case, I replaced 'Sponge' with the 'Encephalon', and then I've got my Blog name -- Menger Encephalon!
