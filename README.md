Welcome to my blog! And there will be lot of fun and huge of crazy things!

So, you may ask me, what's the name of the blog means? Okay, Let's sit, and Let me tell:

# The Meaning of the Menger Encephalon
Firstly, I am a Prion, right? So, I need to live in a brain. And then, I hope the brain I live in could be more wisdom, so I choose the 'encepahlon' (witch from Acient Greek)
A Brain witch prion living in, always is like a sponge witch has a lot of holes. So, how to describe this shape? I remind the Menger Sponge, witch is a famous fractal.
Then, I just use the 'encephalon' to place the 'sponge', and then I got the name of my blog -- Menger Encephalon!
